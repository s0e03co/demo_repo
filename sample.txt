Repository --> Code Base --> where u write ur code

Teams -> multiple developers who will be contributing to the Repository

Parallel development --> Git helps collaboration 
 
By Default Git provides a master branch (main) 

Main (Folder) -> Contains list of files which is stable

                   Root(Main)

             Branch1 Branch2 Branch 3

Dev1(electrical) --> Branching Branch1 checkout main 
Dev2(wood work)--> Branching Branch2 checkout main
.
.
.
Dev n

Once a developer done his development in branch1 he will be raising a pull request/merge request 
What is a pullreq? 


Step1: Cloned a branch demo_repo --> git clone <url>
Step2: checkout to new branch from main --> branc1 --> git checkout -b <branch_name>
Step3: Created a sample.txt file --> save this file in demo_repo folder
Step4: add the file to staged area --> git add sample.txt
Step5: commit the staged files to local repository --> git commit -m "proper message what u are commiting"
Step6: pushed the localRepo changes to remote Repository --> git push origin <branch_name>
